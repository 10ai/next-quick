This demo directory should create a symbolic link to the nextjs-cli project via `npm link nextjs-cli`

You can run the cli in here to demo it.
To get started, try `nextjs-cli init`

If you've made local changes to the package but they're not being updated, make sure you go to root directory and run `npm run build` after each time you make changes.

This demo directory should create a symbolic link to the next-quick project via `npm link next-quick`

You can run the cli in here to demo it.
To get started, try `next-quick init`

If you've made local changes to the package but they're not being updated, make sure you go to root directory and run `npm run build` after each time you make changes.
